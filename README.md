Key Highlights:
 Data Preprocessing:
 • Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and transformation.
 • Encoded categorical variables using label encoder.

Machine Learning Models:
 • Implemented DecisionTreeRegressor on the prepared data to forecast demand and optimal inventory

Model Evaluation & Tuning:
 • Used MulticlassClassificationEvaluator to evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy MAE. RMSE and MAPE

Result:
Successfully developed a model that takes on pharmaceutical supplychain data and predicts demand, safety stock, and optimal inventory for the coming year.
